
Server identification
Representative Query
Notes
Host name where the instance is running
select host_name 
from v$instance;
You can also obtain this information by running the following from bash:
 
hostname
or
uname –n
Operating system platform
select platform_name from v$database –-(10g)
 
Similar information is returned if you rununame –s
 
File Information 
Oracle file locations
Representative Query
Notes
Control files
select name 
from v$controlfile;
Location of the database control files. The init.ora parameter control_files also contains this information.
Datafiles
select file_name 
from Dba_data_files;
Location of the database datafiles
Temp files
select file_name 
from Dba_temp_files;
Location of database temporary files
Log files
select member 
from v$logfile;
Location of redo logs
Archived logs
select name 
from v$archived_log
Location of archived redo logs. The init.ora parameters log_archive_dest_n also contain this information. This query will not return results if your database is not in Archivelog mode.
Flash recovery area
select name 
from v$recovery_file_dest
The directory being used in an Oracle 10ginstallation for the flash recovery area. The init.ora parameter db_recovery_file_dest also contains this information.
Other points of access on the file system indicated by parameters
select * 
from v$parameter
where value like '%/%'
or
value like '%/%';
The results of this query can vary significantly, depending on your installation and version of Oracle Database. Parameters that may be returned include:
spfile 
standby_archive_dest 
utl_file_dir 
background_dump_dest user_dump_dest 
core_dump_dest 
audit_file_dest 
dg_broker_config_file1 
dg_broker_config_file2
Programmatic access to the file system
select directory_path from dba_directories
The Oracle UTL_FILE_DIR parameter and DIRECTORY database objects can be used to access files that are not a part of standard database functioning.
 
Process Information 
Processor/Processes
Representative Query
Notes
Session Processes
select p.spid, s.username, s.program
from v$process p, v$session s
where p.addr=s.paddr order by 2, 3, 1
The spid can be correlated with ps –ef results to compare the information available within the database with OS information for a given process.
Processes related to parallelism
select slave_name, status 
from v$PQ_SLAVE
Many aspects of Oracle Database, such as loading, querying, object creation, recovery, and replication, can take advantage of parallelism to speed up activities that can be broken down. The parameter parallel_threads_per_cpu sets an instance’s default degree of parallelism.
 
Memory Information 
Memory
Representative Query
Notes
Program Global Area
select * from V$PGASTAT
The parameter pga_aggregate_target is used to configure memory for all dedicated server connections.
Linux utilities, including vmstat and top, can be used to monitor memory usage.
System Global Area
select * from v$sga
 
 
The parameters SGA_MAX_SIZE and SGA_TARGET are used to configure dynamic memory allocation features of Oracle Database 10 g. Other parameters can be used to manually allocate memory for particular purposes.
Again, various Linux utilities are available to monitor memory allocation.





ORACLE: ADDM, AWR and ASH Utilities
a) An ADDM Report (addmrpt.sql)
-------------------------------
The ADDM reporting utility creates a report of its database performance findings. The addmrpt.sql script is found in the $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin directory. The output is written to the current working directory as a text file.

SQL>@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/addmrpt.sql

b) AWR Report (awrrpt.sql)
-------------------------------
The AWR reporting utility provides an overview of database performance within a specified period of time. It essentially computes the net change in database activity within the period. The awrrpt.sql script is found in the $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin directory. The output is written to the current working directory, please select HTML format.

SQL>@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/awrrpt.sql

c) ASH Report (ashrpt.sql)
----------------------------
The ASH report utility is useful for determining the amount of active sessions, what they were doing, and which SQL statements were most active during a period of time. It is especially useful for analyzing transient performance issues. The ashrpt.sql script is found in the $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin directory. The output is written to the current working directory, please select HTML format.

SQL>@$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/ashrpt.sql
