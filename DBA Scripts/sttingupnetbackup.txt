1. Make sure you have Netbackup licence, Netbackup server software for your platform and the Netbackup agent for Oracle

2. Make sure you have Master Server, Media Server and Tape Library configured.

3. Check the Master Server and other parameters

$ cd /usr/openv/netbackup

$ ls
$ cat bp.conf
4. Test the communication from the master server to the database server by issuing the following command:


$ cd /usr/openv/netbackup/bin
$ ./bpclntcmd -pn

5. Verify that the NetBackup daemons are running:

$ netstat -a | grep bpcd
tcp 0 0 *:bpcd *:* LISTEN
$ netstat -a | grep vnetd
tcp 0 0 *:vnetd *:* LISTEN

The presence of the lines with LISTEN at the end indicates that the NetBackup daemons
bpcd and vnetd are listening to the client requests.

6. Verify that the licenses are all installed. Run the following command:

$ /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/jnbSA

This will open the Admin Console. Check the license, and make sure you have it.

7. Insert the installation CD for NetBackup for Oracle, and mount the CD-ROM
.
8. Log in as root on the database server.

9. Run the script ./install.

10. From the menu, choose the option NetBackup Database Agent.

11. When prompted, choose Y for local installation.

12. From the menu, choose NetBackup for Oracle.

13. Check the log files for any installation-related errors.

14. Now link Oracle to the NetBackup client. Log in to the database server box as the
Oracle software owner.

15. Shut down all the Oracle Databases running on the server under the Oracle Home.

16. Relink Oracle by running the script oracle_link:

$ cd /usr/openv/netbackup/bin
$ ./oracle_link

17. This creates an output in the file /tmp/make_trace.<pid>. Check the file for errors.
