I am certain that the communications and the credentials are correct, I've tried variants and get different errors. I think the problem is the job action. I've tried running batch files as well as OS commands, same result. THere is nothing useful in the core dump.
Is there perhaps a Windows specific technique for running external jobs? Some way of nominating the batch file, or specifying a command interpreter?
Any other suggestions?

Following a suggestion, I've tried this syntax where I nominate a file:
Code: [Select all] [Show/ hide]

exec dbms_scheduler.create_job(-
job_name=>'tryit',-
job_type=>'executable',-
job_action=>'c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe',-
number_of_arguments => 2,-
destination_name=>'jwdell',-
enabled=>false,-
auto_drop=>false,-
credential_name=>'my_cred')

exec dbms_scheduler.set_job_argument_value('tryit',1,'/c');
exec dbms_scheduler.set_job_argument_value('tryit',2,'dir')
